Bingo!

The game is designed for 4 players. Each player has a ticket with 25 random numbers. The game master draws the balls marked from 1 to 100. When a ball is drawn, the player crosses the corresponding tile in the ticket. The player whose all the tiles are marked and claims first is the winner!
